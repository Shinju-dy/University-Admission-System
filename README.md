# University Registration System

## Overview

The University Registration System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of student registration, course enrollment, and management for universities. It facilitates student applications, admissions, and the selection of courses for each academic semester. This project demonstrates the core functionalities of a university registration system.

## Features

- **Student Application**: Prospective students can apply to the university by filling out personal and academic details.
- **Admin Review**: University administrators can review, accept, or reject student applications. Accepted students are automatically assigned a student ID and can proceed to enroll in courses.
- **Course Enrollment**: Enrolled students can select 5 courses from a list of available courses each semester based on their program.
- **User Authentication**: Students can log in using their student ID and birthdate.
- **Profile Management**: Students can view their profile information, including personal details, program, faculty, and department, as well as the courses they are enrolled in for the current semester.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Administrators can manage student applications and view accepted students, including their names, student IDs, and registration timestamps.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: Handles server-side logic and database interactions.
- **MySQL**: Manages the database for student applications, courses, enrollments, and fees.
